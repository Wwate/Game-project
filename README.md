My first platformer game

School project for Java class

Instructions:
1.Download the file 
2.Open in eclipse
3.Go to your phpmyadmin and create a new database called "javadatabase" and set your port to 3306 from Xampp. Insert the sql script from the file into the create table in phpmyadmin.
4.After you've done these the program should be working.

Important info!
Not everything is included in the playable map. There are no sprites for the different types of enemies since it's too much work to animate it all. Mobs have been color coded so you can tell which state they are currently in or what mob they are.

Tutorial:
W: Jump and go up in pipes
A: Move left
S: Go down in pipes
D: Go right
