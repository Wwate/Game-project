DISCLAIMER!!! NOT FINISHED YET. STILL HAS SOME BUGS AND MANY FEATURES ARE UN IMPLEMENTED. WILL UPDATE THIS AS FREQUENTLY AS POSSIBLE. EVERYTHING YOU SEE IS ONLY "TESTING GROUNDS" SO GRAPHICS, MAP ETC. WILL CHANGE. AT THE MOMENT THERE ISN'T MUCH TO PLAY WITH. EVERYTHING IS THERE JUST TO CHECK IT WORKS AND FOR BUG TESTING. THE FINISHED PRODUCT WILL LOOK A LOT DIFFERENT. FEEL FREE TO SEE WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE BUT REMEMBER IT'S A WORKING PROGRESS.
